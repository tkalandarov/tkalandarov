Throughout my five years in the computer software industry, I have honed my skills in software development, testing, and troubleshooting, as well as in collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality results. Moreover, as an international student, I have developed exceptional adaptability and stress-handling skills, which enable me to thrive in fast-paced and dynamic environments.
